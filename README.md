# -KYMONET-A-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Automated-Vocal-Fold-Analysis-Using-Kymograms
Generated kymograms using MATLAB, preprocessed vocal fold videos with RIFE and FFmpeg, and built deep learning models for ternary classification. Achieved 98% accuracy through oversampling, hyperparameter tuning, and thorough metric-based evaluation.
